# AMD GPU Glossary

A comprehensive reference guide for AMD GPU computing, covering hardware architecture, software stack, and performance optimization concepts.

## About

This glossary provides detailed explanations of AMD GPU terminology and concepts, organized into four main sections:

- **Device Hardware**: Physical GPU components and architecture (Compute Units, Stream Processors, Infinity Fabric, etc.)
- **Device Software**: Programming models and execution concepts (HIP, ROCm, Wavefronts, etc.)
- **Host Software**: Development tools, APIs, and libraries (rocm-smi, rocBLAS, MIOpen, etc.)
- **Performance**: Optimization concepts and metrics specific to AMD GPUs

## Focus

This glossary focuses on AMD's datacenter and compute GPUs, particularly the AMD Instinct series (MI300X, MI250X, MI210, MI100, etc.), which are optimized for AI, machine learning, and HPC workloads.

## Structure

The glossary content is organized to help developers understand AMD GPU computing at different levels of the stack, from low-level hardware details to high-level performance optimization strategies.
